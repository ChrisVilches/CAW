# Computer Assisted Writing (CAW)

App developed to be an aid when writing Japanese texts, similar to Grammarly.

[Live demo](http://cloud.chrisvilches.com/live_demos/CAW/)

The phases of this project are:

1. **(DONE)** Scrape thousands of words (synonyms and definitions) from multiple dictionary websites.
2. **(DONE)** Create an API (service) for fetching synonyms.
3. **(INCOMPLETE)** Create a text editor where the user can write, click a word to open a popover that displays synonyms, and replace the word for the selected one.
4. **(NO PROGRESS)** This app will be integrated to device's text input method software, and provide word alternatives/suggestions on the go, facilitating the creation of more sophisticated sentences.
5. **(NO PROGRESS)** Help fixing grammar.

â€» The user must know Japanese, as it only works as an aid, not as a translator.
